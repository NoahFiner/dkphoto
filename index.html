        <p class="subtitle right">Noah Finer is an award-winning photographer, designer, and web developer, along with the founder of Day and Knight Photography. After taking a photography class in his sophomore year at Fairview, he continued to learn whatever was possible about cameras. He has since then taken over @universetoday for a day for his astrophotography, sold prints on bohowallart.com and individually, been featured on 40+ different Instagram hubs, and won Spiky1 the Bearded Dragon of the Month award through professional-grade photos. After massive experience in portraiture from being the media captain of the robotics team, a photographer for the Royal Banner, and the future NHS photographer, he would love to be chosen to take your senior photos!</p>

        <p class="subtitle left">Cormac Dowling has been taking photographs for over two years.  He began in his Junior year photography class, and he later joined his school's local newspaper, the Royal Banner, for photojournalism. He is now head photographer for the Royal Banner and his photographs are featured in each issue of the school paper.  He also has taken many pictures for the school yearbook, as well as photos for a national magazine. He was recently invited to attend two upcoming national conferences to represent Colorado for youth photojournalism. Along with his photojournalism, he enjoys photographing nature and his dogs. He is excited for the experience of working with fellow students. Go Knights!!</p>

        <p class="subtitle right">Stephanie Zhang has enjoyed photography from a young age. In 2015, she started a YouTube channel with her best friend, which was a catalyst for her love of both videography and photography. She has been taking senior pictures for over a year. She is the photographer for her school's National Honor Society, which involves taking pictures at events such as induction. Stephanie is currently applying her photography and videography skills to a travel blog, which will be operational during the summer of 2017. The links for her official photography website, her YouTube channel, and her travel blog can be found below. She is looking forward to an awesome senior year with an awesome class of Knights and can't wait to take your senior portrait!</p>
